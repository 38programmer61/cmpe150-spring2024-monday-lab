# Cmpe 150 Lab 5 Questions

# Question 1 - Fibonacci
# Write a program which reads a positive integer number N and prints the Nth fibonacci number. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...
# F0 = 0
# F1 = 1
# Fn = Fn-2 + Fn-1

# Example Test Case 1: 2 -> 1
# Example Test Case 2: 3 -> 2
# Example Test Case 3: 6 -> 8

# ToDo

# Question 2 - Second Largest
# Write a program that will take nonnegative integers as inputs until the user enters 0.
# Then prints the difference between of largest two numbers among given inputs.

# Example Test Case 1: 12 25 3 8 0 -> 13
# Example Test Case 2: 15 1 2 3 8 5 0 -> 7

# ToDo

# Question 3 - Digiiiits
# Write a function that takes a positive number as a parameter and returns its total digit count and sum of even digits.

# Example Test Case 1: 542175 -> 6 6
# Example Test Case 2: 24680 -> 5 20
# Example Test Case 3: 135 -> 3 0

# ToDo

# Question 4 - Positive Mental Attitude
# Write a function that will take integers as inputs until the user enters a negative number.
# Then prints the user the sum of all ODD non-negative numbers that is entered.

# Example Test Case 1: 4 7 45 9 2 0 0 5 8 -4 -> 66
# Example Test Case 2: 1 1 0 1 -1 -> 3

# ToDo

# Question 5 - NoBig
# Write a function that reads numbers until the entered number is greater than the previous entered number.
# Then return the average of all entered numbers except the last one. Assume that at least two numbers will be entered.

# Example Test Case 1: 5 4 3 3 8 -> 3.75
# Example Test Case 2: 1 2 -> 1.0
# Example Test Case 3: 100 54 46 2 3 -> 50.5

# ToDo

# Question 6 - Guess
# Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (including 1 and 100). Ask the user to guess the number,
# then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. Also print the number of tries.
# Hint: You can use random.randint() but do not forget to say random.seed(5434) before calling in to make the code
# reproducible (5434 is an arbitrary number)

# Example Test Case:
# 35 Too low!
# 67 Too low!
# 73 Too high!
# 71 You got it! And it only took you 4 tries!

# ToDo

# Question 7 - Sum Facts
# Write a function which takes an integer as a parameter and returns the sum of the factorial of each digit.
# For example, assume that the user enters 572 as the input. For each digit of the integer, you will
# compute the factorial. Then you will compute the sum of these factorials: 5! + 7! + 2! = 120 + 5040 + 2 = 5162.

# Example Test Case 1: 572 -> 5162
# Example Test Case 2: 27 -> 5042

# ToDo

# Question 8 - Sum of Digits
# Write a function that takes a nonnegative integer num as a parameter and returns sum of all digits. If the result
# has more than one digit, continue to calculate in this way until a single digit number is produced.
# 16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
# 942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6

# Example Test Case 1: 942 -> 6
# Example Test Case 2: 17703 -> 9

# ToDo

# Question 9 - Prime factors
# Question 9a
# Write a function that takes an integer N as a parameter and prints all the numbers that can divide N.

# Example Test Case 1: 21 -> 1 3 7 21
# Example Test Case 2: 30 -> 1 2 3 5 6 10 15 30

# ToDo

# Question 9b
# Write a function that takes an integer N as a parameter and prints the prime factorization of N.
# Hint: A non-prime number is always composed of prime numbers smaller than it.

# Example Test Case 1: 21 -> 3 * 7
# Example Test Case 2: 60 -> 2 * 2 * 3 * 5

# ToDo

# Question 9c
# Write a function that takes an integer N as a parameter and prints the prime factorization
# of N in the form of exponents.

# Example Test Case 1: 21 -> 3^1 * 7^1
# Example Test Case 2: 60 -> 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1

# ToDo
